Schedule feature is optional but enabled by default. Schedule can be disabled from the `Configuration.plist` by setting `Enable Schedule` key from `App Configuration` to `NO`.

### Scenes

 Scene is a group of parameters with specific values, for one or more devices (optionally) spanning across multiple nodes. As an example, an "Evening" scene may turn on all the lights and set them to a warm colour. A "Night" scene may turn off all the lights, turn on a bedside lamp set to minimal brightness and turn on the fan/ac.

Node Grouping is optional but enabled by default. It can be disabled from the `Configuration.plist` by setting `Enable Grouping` key from `App Configuration` to `NO`.
  
  ### Node Sharing

  Node Sharing allows a user to share nodes with other registered users and allow them to monitor and control these nodes.
  List of operations that are supported in node sharing :

  For primary users:

  - Register requests to share nodes.
  - View pending requests.
  - Cancel a pending request, if required.
  - Remove node sharing.

  For secondary users:

  - View pending requests.

Node Sharing is optional but enabled by default. It can be disabled from the `Configuration.plist` by setting `Enable Sharing` key from `App Configuration` to `NO`.


### Device Automation

Device Automation is a set of actions that will be triggered based on the completion of certain events. For example, the user can set an event as the Temperature sensor equals 35 degrees celsius. Then based on this event user can trigger different actions like Switching on AC or Setting the AC temperature to 20 degrees celsius or a combination of both.

Users will be allowed to perform different automation operations in the app as mentioned below:

1. Adding new automation.
2. Updating existing automation.
3. Enabling/disabling automation triggers.
4. Deleting automation.
5. Receiving notifications related to triggered automation.

Device automation is optional but enabled by default. It can be disabled from the `Configuration.plist` by setting `Enable Device Automation` key from `App Configuration` to `NO`.

### Push Notifications

ESPRainMaker app supports remote notifiations in order to notify app in realtime for any updates. Types of notification enabled in the app :

1. Alert notification: User will be updated by sending alert notification in case of below events:
   - A new node is added to the user.
   - Existing node is removed from the user account.
   - Node sharing request is accepted/declined by secondary user.
   - Alerts triggered from the node.
 
2. Actionable notification: In case a node sharing request is received, user will be be alerted with an actionable notification. This will enable the user to accept or decline the sharing request from the notification center.

3. Silent notifications: This notification is triggered at the time when any of the user device param changes. It will update the app with latest param value in case when app is in foreground.

### Alexa App to App Linking

  This account linking flow enables users to link their Alexa user identity with their Rainmaker identity
  by starting from Rainmaker app. When they start the account linking flow from the app, users can:
  - Discover their Alexa skill through the app.
  - Initiate skill enablement and account linking from within the app.
  - Link their account without entering Alexa account credentials if already logged into Alexa app. They will have to login to Rainmaker once, when trying to link accounts.
  - Link their account from your Rainmaker using [Login with Amazon (LWA)](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/documentation-overview.html), when the Alexa app isn&#39;t installed on their device.

### Time Series

- Time series allows a user to see historical values of parameters plotted as a bar or line chart.
- Users can select different time durations to see reported parameter values like 1 day, 7 days, 4 weeks and 1 year.
- Users can see graph for raw data and can also select from different aggregate types like avg, min, max, count and latest.

Note : Time series feature requires support in firmware. It will be available only for the parameters that have "time_series" property.

### System service

System service allows a primary user of the node to perform node operations like:
- Reboot
- Wi-Fi reset
- Factory reset

Note : System service feature requires support in firmware. It will be available for nodes that has "esp.service.system" configured.

### OTA Update

- Checks if firmware update is available for nodes that requires user approval.

For more details on region-specific configuration settings, refer to the [Region Configuration Guide](./RegionConfig.md).


## Custom Matter Fabric

### What is Matter?
Matter is a unifying standard that provides reliable, secure connectivity across smart home devices. It is being developed by Matter Working Group within the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) as a new, royalty-free connectivity standard to increase compatibility among smart home products, with security as a fundamental design tenet.
The project is built around a shared belief that smart home devices should be secure, reliable, and seamless to use. By building upon Internet Protocol (IP), the project aims to enable communication across smart home devices, mobile apps, and cloud services and to define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification.

### Capabilities
- Commission matter only and matter+rainmaker devices to custom fabric.
- Control matter & matter+rainmaker devices locally using Matter clusters.
- Control matter+rainmaker devices remotely using the Rainmaker cloud.
- Bind switch to light device.
